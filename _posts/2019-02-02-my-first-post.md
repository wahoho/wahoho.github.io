## My first post

I could've hosted my blog with AWS or some hosting service but I didn't want to spend. I didn't want to use existing blog hosting services like hatenablog and medium since you can't really customized how your pages will look like. I decided to use GitHub pages for my blog since it offers the flexibily for customization and it's free!

I'll mainly post technical stuffs related to programming (and probably some weightlifting posts) in English and Japanese. I wanted to improve my writing skills in Japanese also.
